# battery-swap-stations
Internship for MiGriS. 
The main goal of the internship was to identify the most suitable locations for setting up battery swap stations for electric bikes in Hamburg, Antalya, and Dugopolje. All data was collected from open sources, analyzed, visualizations were created, and insights and conclusions were provided.

The key information is presented in the presentation Presentation TU Berlin - MiGriS 2024.pptx.

The file export.geojson was processed using Python (document Bus_stops_Hamburg.ipynb), and a file with public transport stops in Hamburg (stops_coordinates.csv) was created. This file was later added to Tableau for further analysis. Additionally, the Hamburg data.xlsx file and the file I compiled with geographic polygons of Hamburg's districts (Hamburg districts - Copy.geojson) were uploaded to Tableau. All files were processed in Tableau Hamburg.twbx.

The source data for Dugopolje was collected in Dugopole (6).xlsx, and the analysis file in Tableau is named Dugopolje.twbx.

The source data for Antalya was collected in Antalya (3).xlsx, and the analysis file in Tableau is named Antalya.twbx.
